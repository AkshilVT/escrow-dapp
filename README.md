## The code that holds your deal hostage (until it's done)
The Decentralized Escrow Protocol represents a groundbreaking solution to the age-old challenge of establishing trust in transactions. In traditional dealings, a fundamental reliance on trust between parties often becomes a stumbling block, particularly when there is no pre-existing relationship or a history of unfavorable interactions.
By leveraging the power of smart contracts, the protocol introduces a level of transparency and accountability that was previously unattainable. The essence lies in a brilliantly simple yet effective concept: funds are securely held in escrow by a smart contract until both parties have successfully fulfilled their respective obligations. This transformative approach not only guarantees the completion of the transaction but significantly mitigates the inherent risks associated with fraud and deception.
At the core of our protocol is the utilization of blockchain technology, ensuring that every facet of the escrow functionality is not only secure but also immutable. This means that once the terms are set and agreed upon, they are etched into the blockchain, creating an indelible record of the transaction history. This not only safeguards against any tampering or unauthorized changes but also provides an unalterable chronicle that serves as a testament to the integrity of the transaction.

## How it works?
Client: Creates Tasks to get done <br/>
Creator: Chooses tasks and completes them <br/>
Both stake some amount into the contract on the agreement. If either of them rejects, they lose the stake. <br/>


## Technologies used
### Polygon dApp LaunchPad: <br/>
Built an application using dapp launchpad <br/>

### Lighthouse: <br/>
The work submitted by the creators is deployed to Lighthouse and is retrieved later to be used by the client. The perpetual storage stores the creator's work to be accessed anytime, it also serves as a proof to avoid any malicious activity due to its immutability.    <br/>

### Push Protocol chat: <br/>
We used Push Chat to enable conversation between the freelancer and the organization. <br/>

### Scroll:<br/>
Deployed and verified our smart contract on Scroll.<br/>
